     Possible data issues
       The column [SystemLog].[ExecutionMessages].[ExecutionMessageDateTime] on table [SystemLog].[ExecutionMessages] must be
         added, but the column has no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script
         will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values,
         or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
       The column [SystemLog].[ExecutionMessages].[ExecutionPathIdString] on table [SystemLog].[ExecutionMessages] must be
         added, but the column has no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script
         will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values,
         or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
